strongly types languages demand the specififcation of data types.<br>
ts => require typed specificaltion
 Relates to <br>
- Static typing<br>
- dynamic typing <br> 
but is NOT the same thing as strongly typed or loosely typed.<br>
A language that is *STRONGLY TYPED* can be either statically or dynamically typed.<br>

ts => is a statically typed language thus types are checked at compile time <br><br>

js => is dynamically typed thus types are checked at run time<br>

**ts benefits include;**<br>
- self documenting <br>
- catch errors in development<br>
- great for teams<br>
